# An-Open-source-Package-to-Process-and-Analyse-Thermal-and-Multispectral-Images-in-Glasshouse-Environment
A digital platform using thermal and multipsectral images to monitor early symptoms of biotic and abiotic stresses and to screen plant genotypes in glasshouse conditions.
The image processing pipeline includes camera distortion, image registration, thermal rescaling, gradient/illumination correction, segmentataion and generating vegetative indices.
